# BlogSpace
👩🏻‍💻 BlogSpace website built while learning to work with APIs through Frontend Developer Bootcamp on Scrimba.

This project is a combination of code-along and building chunks of the website on my own through challenges set by the teacher.

While working on this project via Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path, I learned/practiced the following concepts:
### Intro to APIs
- Servers & clients
- Request/response cycle
- APIs
- JSON
- `fetch` syntax

### URLs & REST
##### HTTP requests
- URLs, endpoints
- Methods
- Body
- Headers

##### REST APIs
- Resources
- Parameters
- Queries
